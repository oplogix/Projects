## Getting Started

To get started with the Caesar Cipher Tool, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git.

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/caesar-cipher-tool.git

## Usage
The Caesar Cipher Tool provides two main functionalities:

Encoding (Encryption): Enter enc when prompted and provide the plaintext and the shift value. The tool will encode the plaintext using the Caesar cipher.

Decoding (Decryption): Enter dec when prompted and provide the Caesar cipher message. The tool will attempt to decode the message using all possible shift values.

Follow the on-screen instructions to input your choice and messages.

## Examples
Encoding (Encryption)
Choose "enc" when prompted.
Enter the plaintext you want to encrypt.
Provide the shift value (a number to shift the letters in the alphabet).
The tool will display the encrypted message.
Decoding (Decryption)
Choose "dec" when prompted.
Enter the Caesar cipher message.
The tool will attempt to decode the message using all possible shift values and display the results.
